# Project Overview :

   The frontend part of the Hotel Booking App provides users with a smooth, responsive interface for browsing, comparing, and booking hotels. It uses React.js for the UI, Formik for form management, and React Router for handling client-side navigation. Global state management is handled by Context API (or optionally Redux), ensuring state consistency throughout the app.

# Live Demo :

# Features :

  - User Authentication: Login and registration functionality using forms with validation.
  - Browse Hotels: View a list of all hotels with filters like price, amenities, and location.
  - Search & Compare: Search for hotels based on user preferences and compare hotel prices.
  - Booking Management: Users can book hotels, view their booking history, and manage upcoming reservations.
  - Responsive Design: The app adapts to various screen sizes using Bootstrap, ensuring usability across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

# Tech Stack:

  - React.js: Core frontend library for building a dynamic UI.
  - Formik: Used for form validation and state management in login and registration components.  
  - Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive design and layout.

  - Context API / Redux: For global state management across the app.

# Architecture:

  - Components: Reusable React components for login, registration, hotel listing, hotel details, booking form, and more.
  - State Management: Context API (or Redux) is used to manage authentication state, booking data, and hotel data.
  - Client-Side Routing: Implemented using React Router, allowing seamless navigation between different app sections (login, hotels, bookings, etc.).
